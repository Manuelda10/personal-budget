## Details about the project
For the **frontend** of the website I used the following technologies:
* **React.js** as the principal library.
* **React Router Dom v6** to manage the routes in the website.
* **Recharts** to create some of the charts to show the information
* **Sweetalert2** to show some messages in certain actions
* Also an extern cdn for the humburger menu effect


In the case of **backend** I used the following technologies:
* **Cors** to allow frontend connect to the API in the backend.
* **Dotenv** to allow files to access .env variables
* **Node.js** as the principal platform.
* **Express** as the principal framework to provide server-side logic.
* **mysql2** to use MySQL as the principal database management system.
* **nodemon** to see the changes quickly on dev environment.
* **sequelize** as the principal ORM to create models and use the database.
